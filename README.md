Zgpoid -- A Zig port of [libgpoid](https://libgpiod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
##


Very much a quick and dirty port of the C library libpoid. It hasn't been tested very much, if at all, so no guarantees. It's not production ready at all.

Currently, it's very limited, and is hardcoded to only work for linux. It works on, e.g. a Rasberry Pi 4/5 running Debian/Ubuntu.


Note: This project is just a simple Zig wrapper around libgpoid, which has it's own [licenses](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/tree/LICENSES) and [notes on copying](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/tree/COPYING).
